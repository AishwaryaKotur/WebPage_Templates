		<h1>Watch Your Head</h1>
		<p>
			I quote directly from this amazing post to explain why there isn’t an imposition of a penalty as retribution for an offence – “Punishments will not eradicate bad behaviour, they will merely control some of its excesses. And the price we pay for this is that those same punishments legitimise any behaviour that is ‘worth it’. They turn the cheat-or-not decision into an economic one, and we know how humans respond to incentives in those situations. 

            Economic arguments offer us that excuse we’re looking for. Instead of saying, “Yes, I’m a filthy cheat!” we can say, “Look how clever I am, I got a net benefit out of this! The rules are stupid, man, and I beat them. I win.”

            Punishments in Ultimate will allow people to think that way. That’s not rational, but it is human.”
